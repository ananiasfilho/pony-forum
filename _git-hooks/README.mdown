Git Hooks
=========

I included some basic [Git hooks][git-hooks] that improve your workflow and help you run into stupid bugs. They are, of course, entirely optional.

Installation
------------
1. Move the files to `.git/hooks`.
2. Check if the files are executable.
3. If they are not executable, use `chmod +x <filename>` in your terminal.

The Scripts
-----------
### `pre-commit`
On committing your staged changes:

1. Runs the test suite against your new changes. If the test fails, the changes wonâ€™t be committed.

You can overwrite this behaviour by using the `--no-verify` flag when committing.

### `post-checkout`
On switching to another branch:

1. Deletes all `.pyc` files and empty folders, and displays a report.
2. Migrates your database, in case the models between the two branches differ too much.

Thanks to [David Winterbottom][david] for the first of the scripts.
